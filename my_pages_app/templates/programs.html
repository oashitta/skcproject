            The rising number of street children has become a global pandemic. The UN estimates that there are over 150 million street children in the world. In Nigeria in particular, children end up on the streets for various reasons such as the inability of their families to cater to them, being disowned by their families due to superstitious beliefs, loss of parents, sexual and domestic abuse in the home and so much more.</strong>

                    <p>The Mobile Learning outreach is our flagship program which is aimed at nurturing and harnessing talents out of street children through non-traditional educational activities. </p>
                    <p>We have designed a “mobile school” which will be placed in our core target areas where children will be engaged by volunteers in extracurricular activities with the aim of developing each child’s unique abilities and empowering them with the right attitude to seek a better life for themselves.</p>
                    <p>We partner with both public and private sector organisations who provide us with access to their spaces to host our mobile learning programs.</p>

                <h2>Mentoring and Counselling Program</h2>
                <p>Street children are often exposed to complex and difficult circumstances from early-on in life and these experiences could have a lasting negative impact on their mental health and ability to thrive and function well in the mainstream society. As a result of this, they are at a higher risk of substance abuse as a way to deal with the hardship that they face.</p>
                <p>Through our mentoring and counselling program, we work directly with qualified therapists and counsellors in their respective fields to provide support sessions to help the children tackle their addictions and learn better coping mechanisms, amongst other things.</p>

                    <p>We will work closely with public and private sector partners as well as SMEs to organize work placements for candidates who are deemed fit ready for reintegration by our volunteer counsellors and healthcare partners. Placements will be done based on interests and individual talents of each child to ensure that there is a good fit.</p>
